# Jamf Collection

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of scripts designed for use with Jamf. These scripts are tailored to automate various tasks related to device management, configuration, and maintenance within an MDM environment.

### Apps
*Some installer scripts for apps that live outside the "Mac Apps" solution in Jamf for a little more control.*

[swiftdialogInstallHelper](https://github.com/ganidran/Jamf-Collection/blob/main/Apps/swiftdialogInstallHelper.sh) | 
A script that I add to the installer policy along with the swiftDialog package to make it easy for the app icon to update as well as loading font daemons to avoid font errors in the output log. 
<br><br>

</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span"><strong>Xcode Installer</strong></summary>
<br>

[xcodeInstaller](https://github.com/ganidran/Jamf-Collection/blob/main/Apps/xcodeInstaller.sh) | 
Modified script from James Smith's guide [found here](https://smithjw.me/posts/2022-05-20-installing-xcode-xip/).

### Enrollment
*A few scripts deployed at enrollment. They're each part of their own policy. Governed by the "Master Enrollment" script, which then runs the rest of the scripts. It also assumes existing policies are in place for apps based on custom policy events.*
<details>
<summary markdown="span"><strong>Default Apps</strong></summary>
<br>

[defaultApps](https://github.com/ganidran/Jamf-Collection/blob/main/Enrollment/defaultApps.sh) | 
Sets default apps for a browser and an email client via a corresponding agent string. Example: `com.google.Chrome` if you want to make Chrome the default for both. May require a restart and that can be set in this script or elsewhere (it's in the "Master Enrollment" script here). 
<br><br>
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span"><strong>Master Enrollments</strong></summary>
<br>

[masterEnroll](https://github.com/ganidran/Jamf-Collection/blob/main/Enrollment/masterEnroll.sh) | 
Master script used to enroll a machine and properly install all that it may need. It places a full screen window so that a user can't use their machine as items install. It's an alternative to Jamf's solution and others out there to allow for more customization. Once installation is complete, it restarts the computer at the end. It leverages [swiftDialog]([https://www.mit.edu/~amini/LICENSE.md](https://github.com/swiftDialog/swiftDialog/wiki)) for the prompt along with a custom company image (if available).
<br><br>
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span"><strong>Set Desktop Image</strong></summary>
<br>

[setDesktopImage](https://github.com/ganidran/Jamf-Collection/blob/main/Enrollment/setDesktopImage.sh) | 
Sets a desktop image during enrollment. This is contingent on a policy that both installs [desktoppr](https://github.com/scriptingosx/desktoppr) and a custom wallpaper image into /Library/Desktop Pictures. That'll allow for users to both modify it and/or change back to it via System Settings if they want to. Separate from the Jamf solution. 
<br><br>
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span"><strong>Set Dock</strong></summary>
<br>

[setDock](https://github.com/ganidran/Jamf-Collection/blob/main/Enrollment/setDock.sh) | 
Sets a collection of apps, shortcuts and/or folders to the dock based on macOS version. Custom dock is created by Techion's [Dock Master](https://techion.com.au/blog/2015/4/28/dock-master).
<br><br>
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span"><strong>Set User Icon</strong></summary>
<br>

[setUserIcon](https://github.com/ganidran/Jamf-Collection/blob/main/Enrollment/setUserIcon.sh) | 
Sets a predefined user icon during enrollment. This assumes you've packaged and deployed user images to the path in this script earlier in the enrollment process.
